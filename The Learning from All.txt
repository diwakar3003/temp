The Learning from All Vehicles (LAV) network is a framework designed to improve autonomous driving by learning from all vehicles in the environment, not just the ego vehicle. Below is a detailed breakdown of its architecture and components based on the paper:

1. Perception Module
The perception module processes multi-modal sensor data (RGB cameras, LiDAR) to create a robust scene understanding. This module generates a bird's-eye view (BEV) feature map that is invariant to the ego vehicle’s viewpoint and can generalize to other vehicles.

Sensors Used:
RGB Cameras: Capture visual data from multiple angles.
LiDAR: Provides depth and 3D spatial information.
Feature Extraction:
A 3D backbone network (e.g., PointPillars with PointPainting) fuses the LiDAR and RGB data to create the BEV feature map. This map encodes road boundaries, lane markings, vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles.
Auxiliary Tasks:
The perception module is trained with semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. These tasks predict road markings, lane boundaries, and detect vehicles and pedestrians, helping to generate a vehicle-independent spatial representation.
2. Motion Planning Module
This module is responsible for predicting the future trajectories of all vehicles (ego and surrounding vehicles) and planning the ego vehicle’s trajectory accordingly.

Future Trajectory Prediction:

The motion planner predicts a set of waypoints for each vehicle in the scene over a future time horizon (e.g., the next 10-20 steps). These predictions are conditioned on high-level driving commands (e.g., turn left, change lane).
For the ego vehicle, GPS waypoints are also considered to guide the planning.
Waypoints Representation:

The module predicts 2D waypoints that describe the future positions of the vehicles. The output of the motion planner includes both high-level commands (e.g., turn left, turn right, go straight) and fine-grained GNSS goals (Global Navigation Satellite System).
Training:

The planner is trained on all vehicles using their future trajectories. For non-ego vehicles, it infers the most probable high-level command by minimizing the trajectory error for each possible command.
3. Privileged Distillation
A key feature of the LAV network is its privileged distillation approach, which trains the motion planner using two stages:

Stage 1: The motion planner is trained using ground-truth perception and trajectories for all vehicles. This privileged information allows the network to learn accurate planning strategies.

Stage 2: The privileged planner supervises the final planner, which operates solely on the inferred perception outputs (i.e., sensor data without direct ground-truth information). This ensures that the motion planner generalizes well to real-world conditions where only the ego vehicle’s sensor inputs are available.

4. Controller
The low-level controller translates the motion plans into actual driving commands (steering, throttle, and braking) that the vehicle can execute.

PID Controllers:

A latitudinal PID controller handles the steering based on the predicted trajectory waypoints.
A longitudinal PID controller manages acceleration and braking based on the target speed derived from the waypoints and the current speed of the vehicle.
Emergency Stops:

The controller incorporates a brake predictor that stops the vehicle in case of detected hazards such as red lights or imminent collisions. The brake predictor uses a neural network trained to detect these scenarios using the sensor inputs.
5. Vehicle-aware Control
The LAV system is designed to handle partial observability for other vehicles by predicting their motion plans. It incorporates hazard stop detection using predicted trajectories for all vehicles and avoids potential collisions by modifying the ego vehicle’s plan accordingly.

6. Training and Evaluation
The LAV network is trained and evaluated using the CARLA driving simulator. During training, it uses supervised learning from a large dataset of driving logs, focusing on closed-loop driving simulations. The system outperforms previous approaches in terms of driving scores and route completion, thanks to its ability to learn from all vehicles in the environment.
In summary, the LAV network leverages the behavior of all observed vehicles to improve the ego vehicle's decision-making and safety. By combining multi-modal perception, motion prediction, and privileged distillation, LAV achieves superior performance in complex driving scenarios.








The architecture of the Learning from All Vehicles (LAV) Network as described in the paper "Learning from All Vehicles" by Dian Chen and Philipp Krähenbühl comprises several key components, designed to learn from the behaviors of all vehicles in an environment. Here’s an in-depth breakdown of the architecture:

1. Overview
The LAV network is an end-to-end, mapless driving system that learns driving policies from the trajectories and experiences of all vehicles in the scene, not just the ego vehicle. It uses a combination of perception, motion prediction, and motion planning to produce driving commands.

2. Modular Pipeline
The architecture of LAV can be divided into three main modules:

Perception Module
Motion Planning Module
Controller
2.1 Perception Module
The goal of the perception module is to create a vehicle-independent feature representation using multi-modal sensor inputs (RGB cameras, LiDAR) and provide rich supervisory signals for the motion planner. This feature representation should generalize well between different vehicles and should handle partial observability.

Key components:

Multi-modal inputs: RGB cameras and LiDAR are fused together using techniques like PointPainting, where semantic segmentation from RGB images is painted onto LiDAR points.

3D Backbone: The backbone processes this multi-modal data to produce a 2D spatial feature map that encodes the environment.

It uses PointPillars for 3D perception with spatial features in a bird's-eye view (BEV) format.
The backbone predicts semantic features (e.g., lane markings, road boundaries) and object detections (vehicles, pedestrians) from the scene.
Vehicle-Invariant Features: The perception module is trained to minimize the difference between the feature representations of the ego vehicle and other vehicles, helping the motion planner to generalize across vehicles.

Supervised Training: This module is trained using labeled data, with losses based on semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. The ego vehicle is explicitly labeled to enforce feature similarity across vehicles.

2.2 Motion Planning Module
This module predicts the future trajectories of all vehicles, including the ego vehicle, based on the features produced by the perception module.

Key components:

Two-stage motion planner:

Coarse trajectory prediction: The network predicts a series of waypoints that describe the positions to which the vehicles should steer. This is done using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Units), conditioned on high-level commands (e.g., turn-left, go-straight).
Refinement stage: The predicted trajectories are refined iteratively by a second-stage motion planner, which adjusts the trajectory based on a GNSS goal (Global Navigation Satellite System).
Supervision:

For the ego vehicle, the ground truth high-level command is provided (e.g., go-straight, turn-left), making it easier to predict future waypoints.
For other vehicles, their future trajectories are used as supervision signals. However, since the high-level commands of other vehicles are not available, the motion planner learns to infer the most fitting high-level command.
Privileged Distillation: The motion planner first learns from ground truth perception and future trajectories in a privileged setting. Then, the distilled policy learns to plan for all vehicles using only the ego vehicle’s sensor inputs, improving generalization.

2.3 Controller
The controller translates the refined motion plans into low-level driving commands like steering, throttle, and brake. It is designed to handle safety-critical situations like collision avoidance.

Key features:

PID Controllers: Separate controllers handle latitudinal control (steering) and longitudinal control (throttle/brake) based on the predicted trajectories.

Collision Avoidance: The controller uses the predicted trajectories of all vehicles to detect potential collisions and adjusts the ego vehicle’s plan accordingly (e.g., making an emergency stop if a collision is imminent).

Brake Classifier: A separate neural network predicts brake actions based on traffic lights or hazard situations using camera inputs.

3. Training Setup
Supervised Pre-training: The perception module is pre-trained using semantic segmentation and object detection losses to ensure viewpoint-invariant features.
Joint Training: The motion planner is trained on the perception features and is optimized using privileged distillation, allowing it to generalize to unseen vehicles.
End-to-End Training: Finally, the entire system is trained end-to-end, from sensor inputs to driving commands, allowing perception models to attend to details necessary for driving.
4. Performance and Evaluation
LAV achieves state-of-the-art results in the CARLA driving simulator, ranking first on the CARLA leaderboard. The model significantly improves metrics like driving score and route completion rate, outperforming other methods by learning from all observed vehicles, leading to more robust predictions and safer driving policies.

This architecture enables the system to handle a wide range of driving scenarios, improving generalization, collision avoidance, and decision-making by leveraging data from all vehicles in the environment​(2203.11934v3)​(2203.11934v3).




The LAV (Learning from All Vehicles) network, as described in the paper, consists of three main components: Perception Module, Motion Planner, and Controller. Here's a breakdown of the architecture and how each component functions:

1. Perception Module
The perception module is designed to create a robust, generalizable representation of the environment that is invariant across different vehicles. The key goals are to generate a vehicle-independent feature representation and ensure that the learned features transfer well between the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles.

Input: Multi-modal sensor data, including RGB cameras and LiDAR scans.
Backbone: A 3D Backbone processes LiDAR and camera data through PointPillars and PointPainting techniques to fuse RGB images with LiDAR points.
Output: A map-view feature representation that consists of semantic information (e.g., road, lane markings, vehicles) and bounding boxes for objects like pedestrians and vehicles.
The feature representation is used as input to the motion planning module. The perception module learns through supervised pre-training, predicting road masks, lane markings, and detecting objects in the bird's eye view (BEV).

2. Motion Planner
The motion planner is responsible for predicting the future trajectory of both the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles. It uses the map-view features produced by the perception module to plan a series of waypoints that guide vehicle motion.

a. Stage 1 - Coarse Motion Planning
High-level commands (like turn-left, go-straight) and GNSS goals (geometric GPS targets) are provided as input.
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) predicts future waypoints for all vehicles in the scene (including the ego vehicle).
Loss functions: The ego vehicle’s motion plan is supervised directly by its high-level command, while other vehicles’ plans are learned through an inferred command that minimizes trajectory error.
b. Stage 2 - Fine Motion Refinement
After generating coarse trajectories, the motion planner refines these trajectories using another RNN-based network.
The refinement module takes the previous trajectory, the GNSS goal, and the current state to iteratively improve the predicted waypoints.
This refinement is crucial for improving accuracy, particularly in complex driving environments.
3. Controller
The controller converts the planned trajectory into control actions (steering, throttle, brake).

PID Controllers are used for latitudinal (steering) and longitudinal (acceleration) control based on the predicted waypoints.
A brake classifier is employed to handle traffic lights and hazards. It predicts braking behavior based on camera inputs.
The system checks for collisions using predicted trajectories for surrounding vehicles and performs emergency braking if needed.
Training and Supervision
The LAV network uses a technique called privileged distillation. This process involves training on privileged information (ground truth) from all vehicles during the initial phase. Afterward, the model learns from inferred data and sensor inputs alone, ensuring it generalizes well to unseen scenarios.

Vehicle-invariant features: Learned by training the perception model to minimize the difference between ego and other vehicles.
End-to-end training: Once perception and motion planning modules are trained individually, they are fine-tuned together in an end-to-end manner.
Performance
LAV was tested on the CARLA simulator and achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods on driving score and route completion.
The system effectively learns from other vehicles' experiences, enhancing the robustness and generalization of the driving policy.
This architecture enables the system to train and predict from all vehicles in the scene, resulting in a richer set of driving scenarios and better collision avoidance​(2203.11934v3)​(2203.11934v3).

Feel free to choose one or multiple areas!


1. Perception Module
The Perception Module is responsible for processing raw sensor data from the ego vehicle and converting it into a map-view feature representation that can be used by the motion planner. The main goal is to generate a vehicle-independent feature that generalizes across both the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles.

Key Components:
Input Sensors:
RGB Cameras: Three frontal cameras provide multi-view input. The RGB images are used for semantic segmentation and object detection.
LiDAR: A 3D point cloud is generated by the LiDAR sensor, which gives depth information about the environment.
Sensor Fusion:
The LAV network uses a PointPillars architecture combined with PointPainting for multi-modal sensor fusion:

PointPillars: Converts LiDAR point clouds into structured, fixed-size grids or “pillars.” This method processes the sparse point cloud data efficiently.
PointPainting: Semantic information from RGB images is painted onto the LiDAR points to enhance object detection by combining visual and depth information.
Backbone Architecture:
The combined RGB and LiDAR inputs are processed through a 3D Backbone, which generates a 2D bird’s eye view (BEV) representation.
The backbone includes a CenterPoint-style detector that detects objects (vehicles, pedestrians) and predicts road features like lane markings and boundaries.
Output:
The output is a spatial feature map, providing:
Road layout (e.g., lanes, roads)
Object detections (vehicles, pedestrians) with bounding boxes
A feature representation that is used by the motion planner. This feature is vehicle-invariant, meaning it applies equally to both the ego vehicle and nearby vehicles.
Training:
Supervised pre-training is used to train the perception model with semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. By minimizing the difference between the features of the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles, the model learns to represent both types of vehicles similarly.
2. Motion Planner
The Motion Planner is the heart of the LAV network, responsible for predicting future trajectories of the ego vehicle and all nearby vehicles. It operates in two stages: coarse motion planning and motion refinement.

a. Coarse Motion Planning:
Inputs:
Map-view features from the perception module
High-level commands (e.g., turn left, go straight, change lane)
GNSS goal: A GPS target that specifies where the vehicle should go.
The motion planner is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that rolls out a sequence of future waypoints (predicted positions) for the vehicles.
It predicts the next positions in the trajectory for each vehicle, conditioned on high-level commands.
Key Challenge: For surrounding vehicles, the high-level commands are not directly available (unlike the ego vehicle). The model infers the most appropriate high-level command based on vehicle behavior and minimizes the trajectory error using a loss function.
b. Motion Refinement:
After the coarse plan is generated, the refinement network refines the trajectory to improve accuracy.

This step uses another RNN that incorporates more precise GNSS goals and previously predicted waypoints.

The motion refinement network is crucial for handling fine details in trajectory prediction, especially in complex driving situations.

The refined trajectory is the final output of the motion planner and provides a detailed prediction of how the ego vehicle and other vehicles will move in the next few seconds.

Loss Functions:
Lego Loss: Applied to the ego vehicle’s trajectory using ground-truth high-level commands and predicted waypoints.
Lother Loss: Applied to surrounding vehicles by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual waypoints, considering inferred high-level commands.
3. Controller
The Controller converts the planned motion (waypoints) into low-level control commands for the vehicle, including steering, acceleration, and braking.

a. PID Controllers:
The LAV system uses Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers for handling both steering and speed control.

Latitudinal PID (for steering):

Uses one of the future waypoints as an aim point to compute the steering error.
Adjusts the steering angle to ensure the vehicle follows the predicted trajectory.
Longitudinal PID (for throttle and braking):

Uses the speed difference between the vehicle's current speed and the target speed (from the trajectory) to compute the required acceleration or deceleration.
Adjusts throttle and brake to maintain the desired speed.
b. Emergency Braking:
The controller is designed to detect potential collisions by simulating the future trajectories of all nearby vehicles.
If a predicted trajectory intersects with the ego vehicle’s trajectory, the controller overrides the current plan with an emergency braking action.
The brake classifier is trained to handle specific braking scenarios like red light violations or hazards using data from cameras.
4. Privileged Distillation
This is a key training strategy used in LAV to overcome the challenge of partial observability for surrounding vehicles.

a. Privileged Information:
During training, the network has access to ground truth trajectories for all vehicles, including high-level commands and future waypoints (privileged information). This provides the best-case scenario for trajectory prediction.
b. Distillation:
The network first learns from this privileged data in a supervised manner. The privileged motion planner is trained using both ground-truth perception (object positions) and motion data (trajectories).

In the second stage, the network transitions to learning from raw sensor data alone (i.e., the ego vehicle’s perception data). The privileged motion planner supervises the motion planner that uses inferred perception inputs.

The distilled policy uses the learned features from the privileged motion planner and generalizes well, even when no privileged data is available (i.e., during real-time driving when only sensor data is present).

Benefits:
Rich Supervisory Signal: By learning from all vehicles, the model is exposed to more diverse driving scenarios.
Viewpoint-Invariance: Ensures that the network is not biased toward the ego vehicle and can generalize across different vehicles in the environment.
Summary of the LAV Network:
Perception Module: Extracts multi-modal features using RGB and LiDAR data to create a map-view representation that generalizes across vehicles.
Motion Planner: Predicts future waypoints for all vehicles, refining these predictions with an RNN-based system to improve accuracy.
Controller: Translates the motion plan into control commands using PID controllers and handles emergencies with a brake classifier.
Privileged Distillation: Allows the model to learn from privileged data during training and generalize well to real-world conditions using raw sensor inputs.
This modular approach ensures that the LAV network can learn from all vehicles, improving safety, collision avoidance, and route planning in autonomous driving​(2203.11934v3)​(2203.11934v3).
